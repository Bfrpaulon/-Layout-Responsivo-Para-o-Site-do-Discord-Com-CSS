          â€¦where you can belong to a school club, a gamer's group, or a
          worldwide artistic community. Where you and a few friends can spend
          time together. A place that makes it easy to talk every day and
          socialize more often.

          Discord servers are organized into channels with subjects for you to
          collaborate, share or simply talk about the day without clogging up a
          general chat.

        <h2>Here it is easy to find</h2>
        <p>
          Join the voice channel when you're idle. Friends on the same server
          can see you and join right away, without even having to make the call.

          more.
